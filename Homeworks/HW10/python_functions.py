    Assumes y is a vector of length N
    This code then uses a lapped (50% overlapping)
    DCT on segments of y of length blockSize.

    Note: this function zero-pads y to be an even multiple of blockSize.

    An example window that we recommend, so that the transpose of this
    function is its pseudo-inverse is

    caller has access to the window we used.

    This satisfies the Princen-Bradley conditions, meaning that we can
    guarantee  win**2+np.roll(win, int(blockSize/2))**2 == 1.
