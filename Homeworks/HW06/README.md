# Homework 6 related material
This contains some bits of code that you should be writing as part of homework 6 (the rest of the coding solutions are on Canvas).  You should not be using these functions for homework 6, but you *can* use them for later homeworks (homework 8, etc.), in case you never got your homework 6 functions to work. Of course, this all relies on your honesty...
