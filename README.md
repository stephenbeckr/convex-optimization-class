APPM 5630 at CU Boulder
Prof. Becker, Spring 2023. Meeting time: MWF 10:10 -- 11:00 AM, KCEN S161.

Office hours:
- TBD

This repo contains in-class demos and some homework solutions (much of it is from Spring 2021 or even Fall 2018 when this class was taught as a special topics course 4720/5720)

- Here is the [class policy/procedures](policies.md) document (and if you need it for some reason, the [2018 policies/syllabus (PDF)](APPM4720_5720_Fall2018_Syllabus.pdf)).
- Here is the [syllabus (details on the content)](syllabus.md) document (and if you need it, the [day-by-day schedule](Fall2018_day-by-day_schedule.pdf) from Fall 2018 has even more details on what we covered)
