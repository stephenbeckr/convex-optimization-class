# Class-specific policies

Advanced Convex Optimization, APPM 5630. University of Colorado Boulder, Spring 2021.

[Canvas link](https://canvas.colorado.edu/) (via SSO)

## Details in a nutshell
This class is expected to sometimes meet remotely, sometimes in person, depending on CU's current COVID-19 status.

When we meet **remotely**, this is a flipped class. Students are responsible for watching pre-recorded videos made by the instructor  (and get attendance points by filling out PlayPosit quizzes).  At the usual classtime, we meet via zoom to have a live session which is either for **demos** or **Q&A**, e.g., more like office hours.  During remote weeks, we'll only have **one hour of office hours** since the main lecture is like office hours.  The zoom link is listed in [Canvas](https://canvas.colorado.edu/).

When we meet **in person**, this is a traditional class. The instructor gives a lecture in the classroom.  We will have **three hours of office hours** on these weeks; the office hours will be via zoom since we are not allowed to actually meet in an office due to COVID-19 restrictions (same zoom link as used for remote sessions).  If a student does not want to attend class in person, they may request that we setup a live-stream via zoom, which can be recorded.


## Instructor and contact Information

- The instructor is Stephen Becker, Assistant Professor of Applied Mathematics
- Contact him at <stephen.becker@colorado.edu>
- There are no teaching assistants (TAs) for this course

## Meeting times
Meeting time: MWF 10:20 -- 11:10 AM.  When we meet in person, the location is ECCR 1B40. When we meet remotely, use the zoom link (to be found in [Canvas](https://canvas.colorado.edu/)).

## Office Hours
Prof. Becker's office hours (all held via zoom):

**In-person weeks**
- 3-5 PM Thursdays
- 1-2 PM Fridays

**Remote weeks**
- 4-5 PM Thursdays


## Course Topic Information and Syllabus
See the separate [syllabus document](syllabus.md).

## Estimated Workload
This is intended to have a normal workload for an elective course, lower than the workload for a core course

## Prereqs
APPM 3310 “Matrix Methods” or similar; but APPM 4440 “Real Analysis” or equivalent (e.g., APPM 5440) is suggested. A first-course on optimization like CSCI 5254 “Convex Optimization” is helpful but not necessary.

## Textbook
See the separate [syllabus document](syllabus.md).

## Recitations
There are no recitations

## Exams
There are no exams

## Projects

There is one project, worth 20% of your grade. The last few weeks, there will be no/less homework and instead there is a final project, which is open-ended. Students are encouraged to form groups (up to three people). It can be either theory or computation. Topics should be discussed with the instructor. The final week, groups will give brief (about 10 min) presentations on their topic.

## Homeworks

There will be bi-weekly double-homeworks, consistent of two parts (theory and programming), so we count this as two homeworks.  You are allowed to drop two single homeworks (this will be done automatically), meaning either one double-homework or mix-and-match.

## Grading
- 10% for participation
  - When we meet **in-person**, this is either an **attendance** score or a **reading** score (via Perusall)
    - If you miss a class for a legitimate reason (sickness, important travel), you can be excused.  Doctor's notes are not needed to document illness (traveling to the student health center when only mildly sick can in fact be dangerous, as you spread disease to very sick people).
  - When we meet **remotely**, this is a PlayPosit score: fill out the PlayPosit quizzes that are wrapped around some of the posted videos. Access these links via Canvas.
- 70% Homework.
  - Late homework is not accepted, but you are allowed two free "dropped" homeworks. Your lowest-scoring homeworks will be automatically dropped. See below for caveat
- 20% Project

The overall grade may be **curved** as appropriate (not guaranteed), but note that there is no set "quota" of A's, B's, etc., so you are not directly competing with your classmates.

**Note**: To get a grade of "A", you **cannot drop any homeworks**.  If you have to drop a homework, then the highest grade you can get is "A-".  (There are no "A+" grades at CU)

## Late assignment and cheating policy

In general, **late homework** assignments are not accepted; instead, you can use your two dropped homeworks.  Under exceptional circumstances (such as serious illness, including COVID-19, or serious family issues), homework can be turned in late.  If the reason is foreseeable (e.g., planned travel), you must contact the instructor in advance.

Examples:
- Your sister is getting married and you have to travel out-of-state.  That's great, but this is when you use the one dropped homework. This is foreseeable, and not an "emergency", so it does not count as an exceptional circumstance.
- A close family member becomes infected with COVID-19 and you have to return to your home country to take care of family.  This *does* count as an exceptional circumstance. Please email the instructor to discuss arrangements.

**Cheating** is not acceptable.  Take-home exams and homeworks are easy to cheat on if you really want to, but as this is an upper-division course, I am relying on the fact that students are here to learn (and paying the university to do so), and thus cheating does not make sense.  Cheating does not hurt the instructor, it hurts the student (and hurts the grades of honest classmates).

If a student is caught cheating, on the first occurrence, the penalty ranges from losing points on the item in question (like one test problem; this is for very minor infractions) to losing all points for the assignment (i.e., the entire homework or entire exam). Students may be referred to the honor council. On the second occurrence of cheating, similar penalties may apply, and additionally the student may fail the class, at the instructor's discretion.

"Minor infractions" include not following the instructions during an exam (in person or remote). For example, if the instructions on a remote test are to keep your microphone on and your hands in sight of your webcam, then failing to follow these instructions construes a minor infraction, and (even though cheating may not be proven) you are subject to losing points.

On homeworks, you are free to **collaborate** with other students, and to use resources like the internet appropriately. However, you must do your own work. There is a gray area between collaboration and cheating, and we rely on the students' and instructors discretion.  Copying code verbatim is never permissible.  You should be writing up your own work, and explaining answers in your own words.  Snippets of code are allowed to be similar (sometimes there is only one good way to do it), but longer chunks of code should never be identical.  If not expressly forbidden by the assignment, you may use the internet, but you may never post for help on online forums.  (Regarding forums, please use our Piazza website if you want a Q&A forum).

Cheating is not usually an issue in this class, and I have faith that students will continue to act appropriately.



## Course website

We will use [github](https://github.com/stephenbeckr/convex-optimization-class) for public content (notes, demos, syllabus), and use CU's default LMT **Canvas** for private content like grades and homework solutions.  Canvas will also be used to organize things, like the **pre-recorded lectures** (posted as unlisted on Youtube, with links in Canvas), comments made via **gradescope**, and Q&A forums via **piazza**.

## Notes
When the class meets remotely, handwritten notes will be posted to the github website. When the class meets in person, notes will probably **not** be posted.

In Fall 2018, Mitchell Krock started some [typed notes](https://github.com/stephenbeckr/convex-optimization-class/tree/master/TypedNotes) that are hosted on our github website; you are free to use these. You can also add to them; just make a pull request on github, or if you want to make a lot of changes, ask to be added as a collaborator on github.



## Online behavior
On zoom, please have your webcam on if at all possible
- Valid reasons for not having the camera on: to protect the privacy of your family or roommate, if you cannot have a virtual background
- Invalid reason: you don't feel like it, or you didn't wash your hair.

We have the same standards of behavior as we would in a classroom: appropriate attire, appropriate and not distracting virtual backgrounds, verbal and chat remarks should be respectful, etc.  Real-world backgrounds should be appropriate and professional (please, no drugs or alcohol behind you).

It's always important to have respectful remarks, and even more so in an online setting, since it is easier to get carried away with chat comments since you cannot see the effect on other people.

If we enable private chat on zoom, remember that the zoom host can later see even "private" chats. Inappropriate or inconsiderate remarks, even on private chats, are not allowed.


## Dropping the Course
Advice from your department advisor is recommended before dropping any course. After 11:59 PM Mon Feb. 1, dropping a course results in a "W" on your transcript and you’ll be billed for tuition. After 11:59 PM Wed Mar. 24, dropping the course is possible only with a petition approved by the Dean’s office.

Note that due to COVID-19, these requirements or dates may change.

# Generic policies

## CLASSROOM BEHAVIOR

Students who fail to adhere to these requirements will be asked to leave class, and students who do not leave class when asked or who refuse to comply with these requirements will be referred to [Student Conduct and Conflict Resolution](https://www.colorado.edu/sccr/). For more information, see the policies on [COVID-19 Health and Safety](https://www.colorado.edu/policies/covid-19-health-and-safety-policy) and [classroom behavior](http://www.colorado.edu/policies/student-classroom-and-course-related-behavior) and the [Student Code of Conduct](http://www.colorado.edu/osccr/). If you require accommodation because a disability prevents you from fulfilling these safety measures, please see the “Accommodation for Disabilities” statement on this syllabus.

All students who are new to campus must complete the [COVID-19 Student Health and Expectations Course](https://www.colorado.edu/protect-our-herd/how#anchor1). Before coming to campus each day, all students are required to complete the [Buff Pass](https://pass.colorado.edu/login).

Students who have tested positive for COVID-19, have symptoms of COVID-19, or have had close contact with someone who has tested positive for or had symptoms of COVID-19 must stay home. In this class, if you are sick or quarantined, please contact the instructor via email; you do not need to disclose the exact nature of your illness.

[//]: # (Faculty: insert your procedure here for students to alert you about absence due to illness or quarantine. Because of FERPA student privacy laws, do not require students to state the nature of their illness when alerting you.  For markdown comments, see https://stackoverflow.com/a/20885980)

## ACCOMMODATION FOR DISABILITIES
If you qualify for accommodations because of a disability, please submit your accommodation letter from Disability Services to your faculty member in a timely manner so that your needs can be addressed.  Disability Services determines accommodations based on documented disabilities in the academic environment.  Information on requesting accommodations is located on the [Disability Services website](https://www.colorado.edu/disabilityservices/). Contact Disability Services at 303-492-8671 or <dsinfo@colorado.edu> for further assistance.  If you have a temporary medical condition, see [Temporary Medical Conditions](http://www.colorado.edu/disabilityservices/students/temporary-medical-conditions) on the Disability Services website.

## PREFERRED STUDENT NAMES AND PRONOUNS
CU Boulder recognizes that students' legal information doesn't always align with how they identify. Students may update their preferred names and pronouns via the student portal; those preferred names and pronouns are listed on instructors' class rosters. In the absence of such updates, the name that appears on the class roster is the student's legal name.

## HONOR CODE
All students enrolled in a University of Colorado Boulder course are responsible for knowing and adhering to the Honor Code. Violations of the policy may include: plagiarism, cheating, fabrication, lying, bribery, threat, unauthorized access to academic materials, clicker fraud, submitting the same or similar work in more than one course without permission from all course instructors involved, and aiding academic dishonesty. All incidents of academic misconduct will be reported to the Honor Code (<honor@colorado.edu>); 303-492-5550). Students found responsible for violating the academic integrity policy will be subject to nonacademic sanctions from the Honor Code as well as academic sanctions from the faculty member. Additional information regarding the Honor Code academic integrity policy can be found at the [Honor Code Office website](https://www.colorado.edu/osccr/honor-code).

## SEXUAL MISCONDUCT, DISCRIMINATION, HARASSMENT AND/OR RELATED RETALIATION
The University of Colorado Boulder (CU Boulder) is committed to fostering an inclusive and welcoming learning, working, and living environment. CU Boulder will not tolerate acts of sexual misconduct (harassment, exploitation, and assault), intimate partner violence (dating or domestic violence), stalking, or protected-class discrimination or harassment by members of our community. Individuals who believe they have been subject to misconduct or retaliatory actions for reporting a concern should contact the Office of Institutional Equity and Compliance (OIEC) at 303-492-2127 or <cureport@colorado.edu>. Information about the OIEC, university policies, [anonymous reporting](https://cuboulder.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_0PnqVK4kkIJIZnf), and the campus resources can be found on the [OIEC website](http://www.colorado.edu/institutionalequity/).

Please know that faculty and instructors have a responsibility to inform OIEC when made aware of incidents of sexual misconduct, dating and domestic violence, stalking, discrimination, harassment and/or related retaliation, to ensure that individuals impacted receive information about options for reporting and support resources.

## RELIGIOUS HOLIDAYS
Campus policy regarding religious observances requires that faculty make every effort to deal reasonably and fairly with all students who, because of religious obligations, have conflicts with scheduled exams, assignments or required attendance.

In this class, if the homework is due on the date of a religious holiday, you are expected to turn the homework in **early**. If you have a religious holiday that lasts longer than one week, and so therefore you would not receive the homework with enough time to turn it in early, talk to the instructor at the beginning of the semester. For participation grades, talk to the instructor the **week before** the holiday.
